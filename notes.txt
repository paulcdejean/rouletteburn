Above is useful info to avoid hitching the main thread

Any synchronous hitches will screw up timings a lot

Use performance now() to resync clocks

Correct waits at the beginning

After the wait, drop hack and grow calls that fall outside of their windows, and tprint a notice

"When grow finishes, it grows the server based on the security level at the moment that it finishes"

"so the timing is based on the start, but the growth amount is based on the finish"

That means HWGW, HGW and HG*W (HGHGHGHGW) are all viable
